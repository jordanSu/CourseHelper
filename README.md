This is a helper to help lookup course in NCKU

## Usage
### GUI.py
well, just skip it. I just want to try GUI in python.

### course.py
#### Synopsis
```$ python course.py [Dept No.] [Course No.] [SemYear Semester]```<br><br>
You can use:<br>
```$ python course.py <Dept No.>```<br>
to list all the course in that department immediately.

Or use:<br>
```$ python course.py <Dept No.> <Course No.>```<br>
to find a specific course in the department

Or use:<br>
```$ python course.py <SemYear> <Semester>```<br>
to list all the course in the specific semester in that department 

Or you can just type:<br>
```$ python course.py```<br>

## Next to do
- Use webpage to parse all the information by JavaScript
- Add notification to notice user when the course is available
- Maybe can help user fast login to get the course
