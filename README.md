# CourseHelper
This is a helper to help lookup course in NCKU

## Usage
### GUI.py
well, just skip it. I just want to try GUI in python.

### course.py
You can use:<br>
```$ python course.py <Dept No.>```<br>
to find all the course in that department immediately.

Or just type:<br>
```$ python course.py```<br>
to enter a verbose mode.
